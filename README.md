In order to load data from the data.js file, I first selected the html body and appended rows and table data using a forEach function.

I then modified code used in a previous activity to assure that the data can be filtered when a date is added as well as the buttom is clicked.  This has been tested and works as expected.

The table data will refresh once the page is refreshed.

I attempted to start the level 2 option, but ran into problems and aborted the exercise.
